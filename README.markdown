Mediatizr 0.1.0
===============

This library adds media queries support to browsers that don't support it (like Internet Explorer 5.5-8), using [Sheethub](https://github.com/pyrsmk/Sheethub) and [W](https://github.com/pyrsmk/W). It's easy of use: just add it to your website and it will run by itself.

Features
--------

- px/em values
- min-width/max-width
- min-device-width/max-device-width
- resizing, zooming and text size changing will re-evaluate media queries for live responsive adjustment

Dependencies
------------

You can choose among 3 script versions to minimize bandwith use and maximize simplicity. If you've already added one of these libraries (or both) into your project, then take the simple minified mediatizr version, else take one with the script(s) that you haven't included.
